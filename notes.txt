 
Number of Rows in Train:  260753 Number of columns:  299
Number of Rows in Test:  173836 Number of columns:  298

Removing all columns w/ missing values from all training/test: 143 columns left 


TODO: 
re-factor into new script that uses gridsearch CV
optimize params for other algos w/ gridsearch CV
if promising: try to combine models
submit final solution and upload files to Git 


RandomForest Param optimization: 
criterion: optimized to entropy (very early - re-opt)
num_ensembles: set to 100 (can run 300 but slow)
max_features: limiting does not help but 25 is enough (sqrt(N))
max_depth: stabablized at 20-40 (may need higher for higher max features)
class_weight: no clear effect 
criterion: no diff (gini faster) w/ a few different param settings 
min_samples_split: small diff between 1,2,3. Near 100, in-sample went down, oos good (less variance)
                    - set at 20


Current Best Model: 
Input: 
drop_na_cols = True #cannot set this to False. TODO: use Imputer class to handle missing values
n_estimators = 300 #minimal improvement past 300 
max_depth = 100
max_features = 25 
min_samples_split = 20
min_samples_leaf = 1
